We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 

- [Terraform 1.x.x](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/terraform-do-modules/terraform-digitalocean-firewall/releases).


### Simple Example
Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
```hcl
     module "firewall" {
     source             = "terraform-do-modules/firewall/digitalocean"
     version            = "1.0.0"
     name               = "app"
     environment        = "test"
     allowed_ip         = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
     allowed_ports      = [22, 80]
     droplet_ids        = []
     kubernetes_ids     = []
     load_balancer_uids = []
     }
```

### databases firewall Example
Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
```hcl
     module "firewall" {
     source                     = "terraform-do-modules/firewall/digitalocean"
     version                    = "1.0.0"
     name                       = local.name
     environment                = local.environment
     database_firewall_enabled  = true
     database_cluster_id        = ""
     rules = [
        {
          type  = "ip_addr"
          value = "192.168.1.1"
        },
      ]
     }
```

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| cluster\_id | The ID of the target database cluster. |
| database\_uuid | A unique identifier for the firewall rule. |
| droplet\_ids | The list of the IDs of the Droplets assigned to the Firewall. |
| id | A unique ID that can be used to identify and reference a Firewall. |
| inbound\_rule | The inbound access rule block for the Firewall. |
| name | The name of the Firewall. |
| outbound\_rule | The name of the Firewall. |




## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
